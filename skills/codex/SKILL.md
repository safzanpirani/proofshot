# ProofShot — Visual Verification Workflow

ProofShot is an open-source, agent-agnostic CLI that lets you verify your own work in a real browser — video proof, screenshots, and error reports, no vendor lock-in.

## When to use

Use ProofShot after:
- Building a new UI feature or page
- Modifying existing UI components
- Fixing a visual bug
- Any change that affects what the user sees

## The workflow (always follow these 3 steps)

### Step 1: Start the session

```bash
proofshot start --run "your-dev-command" --port PORT --description "what you are about to verify"
```

This opens a browser and begins recording. If the port is already in use, proofshot will kill the existing process automatically.

**Always use `--run`** to let proofshot start and capture your dev server output (server logs appear in the proof report).
Only omit `--run` if the server was explicitly started by the user or another process — without it, no server logs are captured.

If a previous session was not stopped cleanly, add `--force` to override it.

### Step 2: Drive the browser and test

Use proofshot exec to navigate, interact, and verify:

```bash
proofshot exec snapshot -i                                    # See interactive elements
proofshot snapshot -i                                         # Equivalent shorthand
proofshot exec open http://localhost:PORT/page                # Navigate to a page
proofshot exec click @e3                                      # Click a button
proofshot exec fill @e2 "test@example.com"                    # Fill a form field
proofshot exec screenshot step-NAME.png                       # Capture key moments
```

Take screenshots at important moments — these become the visual proof.
Verify what you expect to see by reading the snapshot output.

If the project volume is low on space, start with `--output` pointing at a
writable temp directory or another volume.

### Step 3: Stop and bundle the proof

```bash
proofshot stop
```

This stops recording, collects console + server errors, and generates
a SUMMARY.md with video, screenshots, and error report.

### Step 4 (optional): Post proof to the PR

```bash
proofshot pr              # Auto-detect PR from current branch
proofshot pr 42           # Target a specific PR number
```

This uploads screenshots and video to GitHub and posts a formatted comment on the PR. By default it uses the official GitHub contents API on a `proofshot-artifacts` branch. Use `--upload-provider github-web-attachments` if you specifically want GitHub attachment URLs.

## Tips

- Always include a meaningful --description so the human knows what was tested
- Take screenshots before AND after key actions (e.g., before form submit, after redirect)
- If you find errors during verification, fix them and re-run the workflow
- Use `proofshot pr` after stopping to attach proof directly to the pull request
