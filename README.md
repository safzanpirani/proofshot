## Why ProofShot?

AI coding agents build UI features blind. They write code but can't verify the result looks right, works correctly, or throws no errors.

ProofShot closes the loop: an open-source CLI that plugs into *any* AI coding agent and gives it a verification workflow — test in a real browser, record video proof, collect errors, and bundle everything for the human to review.

The human gets a video recording, screenshots of key moments, and a report of any console or server errors found. View artifacts locally, or run `proofshot pr` to upload everything to the GitHub PR as an inline comment. No vendor lock-in. No cloud dependency.

  <br>
  <em>The interactive viewer: video recording with scrub bar, action markers, and step-by-step timeline</em>
</p>

## How Is This Different?

The #1 question: "Why not just use Playwright MCP / Chrome DevTools MCP / agent-browser directly?"

**Short answer:** those tools control a browser. ProofShot is a verification workflow that bundles proof artifacts for human review.

| | Playwright MCP | DevTools MCP | agent-browser | ProofShot |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Browser control | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (via agent-browser) |
| Video recording | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Screenshot capture | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Console error collection | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Dev server log capture | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Error detection (10+ languages) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Action timeline with timestamps | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Interactive HTML viewer | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Video-synced log playback | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| PR comment upload (`proofshot pr`) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Visual diff (`proofshot diff`) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Agent-agnostic skill install | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Compact element refs (vs full a11y tree) | ❌ | N/A | ✅ | ✅ |

ProofShot sits **on top of** agent-browser. It adds session management, server log capture, error detection, video trimming, timestamp synchronization, the interactive viewer, and the PR upload workflow. The browser primitives come from agent-browser — ProofShot is the verification layer.

**Use Playwright MCP or DevTools MCP** if you want live debugging or DOM inspection during development. **Use ProofShot** if you want bundled proof artifacts you can review in seconds or attach to a PR.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g proofshot
proofshot install
```

The first command installs the CLI and [agent-browser](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser) (with headless Chromium). The second detects your AI coding tools and installs the ProofShot skill at user level — works across all your projects automatically.

## How It Works

Three-step workflow: **start**, **test**, **stop**.

```bash
# 1. Start — open browser, begin recording, capture server logs
proofshot start --run "npm run dev" --port 3000 --description "Login form verification"
# If the project volume is low on space, put artifacts elsewhere:
proofshot start --output /tmp/proofshot-artifacts --port 3000 --description "Login form verification"

# 2. Test — the AI agent drives the browser
agent-browser snapshot -i                                    # See interactive elements
proofshot snapshot -i                                        # Logged shorthand during a session
agent-browser open http://localhost:3000/login               # Navigate
agent-browser fill @e2 "test@example.com"                    # Fill form
agent-browser click @e5                                      # Click submit
proofshot exec screenshot step-login.png                      # Capture proof (path is relative to the session folder)

# 3. Stop — bundle video + screenshots + errors into proof artifacts
proofshot stop
```

The skill file teaches the agent this workflow automatically. The user just says *"verify this with proofshot"* and the agent handles the rest.

## Output Artifacts

Each session produces a timestamped folder in `./proofshot-artifacts/`:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `session.webm` | Video recording of the entire session |
| `viewer.html` | Standalone interactive viewer with scrub bar, timeline, and Console/Server log tabs |
| `SUMMARY.md` | Markdown report with errors, screenshots, and video |
| `step-*.png` | Screenshots captured at key moments |
| `session-log.jsonl` | Append-only action outcomes with timestamps, status, URL, and evidence data |
| `result.json` | Machine-readable assertions and evidence availability |
| `manifest.json` | Explicit screenshot and metadata manifest |
| `server.log` | Dev server stdout/stderr (when using `--run`) |
| `console-output.log` | Browser console output |

The viewer also includes tabs for browsing console and server logs, with error highlighting and timestamps synced to the video:

## Commands

### `proofshot install`

Detect AI coding tools on your machine and install the ProofShot skill. Run once per machine.

```bash
proofshot install               # Interactive tool selection
proofshot install --only claude  # Only install for specific tools
proofshot install --skip cursor  # Skip specific tools
proofshot install --force        # Overwrite existing installations
```

### `proofshot start`

Start a verification session: browser, recording, error capture.

```bash
proofshot start                                        # Server already running
proofshot start --run "npm run dev" --port 3000         # Start and capture server
proofshot start --description "Verify checkout flow"    # Add description to report
proofshot start --url http://localhost:3000/login       # Open specific URL
proofshot start --headed                                # Show browser (debugging)
proofshot start --force                                 # Override a stale session from a previous crash
proofshot start --run "npm run dev" --take-port         # Deliberately take an occupied port
```

You can also configure browser launch behavior in `proofshot.config.json`:

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "configPath": "./agent-browser.local.json",
    "ignoreHttpsErrors": true,
    "executablePath": "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
  }
}
```

Set `browser.configPath` when you need ProofShot to run `agent-browser` against a project-specific config instead of inheriting `~/.agent-browser/config.json`. Relative paths are resolved from the directory that contains `proofshot.config.json`.

### `proofshot stop`

Stop recording, collect errors, generate proof artifacts.

```bash
proofshot stop              # Stop session and close browser
proofshot stop --no-close   # Stop but keep browser open
proofshot stop --allow-incomplete # Deliberately accept unavailable evidence
```

### `proofshot exec`

Pass-through to agent-browser with automatic session logging. Captures timestamps, element data, and resolves screenshot paths.

When a ProofShot session is active, `proofshot exec` reuses the same isolated `agent-browser` session that `proofshot start` created for that run. This keeps screenshots, console logs, video recording, and browser actions pointed at the same browser session.

```bash
proofshot exec click @e3
proofshot exec screenshot step-checkout.png
proofshot screenshot cropped.png --viewport-only
proofshot assert visible "Checkout"
proofshot assert no-console-errors
```

### `proofshot diff`

Compare current screenshots against a baseline for visual regression.

```bash
proofshot diff --baseline ./session-a --current ./session-b --threshold 0.1
```

### `proofshot pr`

Upload session artifacts to GitHub and post a verification comment on the PR. Finds all sessions recorded on the current branch, uploads screenshots and video, and posts a formatted comment with embedded screenshots.

```bash
proofshot pr              # Latest session matching current HEAD
proofshot pr 42           # Target a specific PR
proofshot pr --session ./proofshot-artifacts/session-name
proofshot pr --all-sessions --sha HEAD
proofshot pr --dry-run    # Preview the markdown without posting
proofshot pr --upload-provider github-web-attachments  # Use GitHub's internal attachment flow
```

By default, ProofShot uses the official GitHub repository contents API and uploads artifacts to a dedicated `proofshot-artifacts` branch. This works with normal `gh` authentication and `GH_TOKEN`.

The `github-web-attachments` provider is still available for inline GitHub-hosted media, but it relies on GitHub's internal web upload endpoint and may reject browser-based `gh auth login` OAuth sessions.

Converts `.webm` video to `.mp4` if `ffmpeg` is available.

### `proofshot clean`

Remove artifacts after validating the configured path.

```bash
proofshot clean
proofshot clean --dry-run --older-than 7d
proofshot clean --trash --older-than 4w
```

### `proofshot doctor`

Print the current ProofShot environment, including config path, browser mode, viewport, installed binaries, and any active session.

```bash
proofshot doctor
proofshot doctor --json
```

### `proofshot run`

Run a repeatable scenario with viewports, assertions, screenshots, and error policies.

```bash
proofshot run proofshot.scenario.json
```

## Supported Agents

`proofshot install` detects and configures skills for:

| Agent | Install location |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/skills/proofshot/SKILL.md` |
| **Cursor** | `~/.cursor/rules/proofshot.mdc` |
| **Codex (OpenAI)** | `~/.codex/skills/proofshot/SKILL.md` |
| **OpenCode** | `~/.config/opencode/skills/proofshot/SKILL.md` |
| **Gemini CLI** | Appends to `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` |
| **Windsurf** | Appends to `~/.codeium/windsurf/memories/global_rules.md` |

All skills install at **user level** — no per-project configuration needed.

## Try It

The repo includes sample apps so you can see ProofShot in action without your own project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmElmo/proofshot.git
cd proofshot
pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm link --global "$(pwd)"

# Set up the sample app
cd test/fixtures/sample-app
npm install
```

Open your AI agent in the `test/fixtures/sample-app/` directory and prompt it:

> Verify the sample app with proofshot. Start on the homepage, check the hero section, navigate to the Dashboard and check the metrics, then go to Settings and update the profile name. Screenshot each page.

Or run the automated test script without an agent:

```bash
bash test-proofshot.sh
```

Check `proofshot-artifacts/` for the video, screenshots, and report.

## Error Detection

ProofShot automatically detects errors from server logs across 10+ languages: JavaScript/Node.js, Python, Ruby/Rails, Go, Java/Kotlin, Rust, PHP, C#/.NET, Elixir/Phoenix, and more. Add patterns for new languages in [`src/utils/error-patterns.ts`](src/utils/error-patterns.ts).

## Documentation

- **[Architecture](docs/architecture.md)** — How ProofShot works under the hood, why agent-browser was chosen, the session lifecycle, viewer internals, and design decisions.
- **[Test Apps](docs/test-apps.md)** — Three sample apps with ready-to-use prompts for testing ProofShot end-to-end across different UI patterns (SaaS dashboard, kanban board, chat interface).

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! The project uses TypeScript (ESM-only) with tsup for builds and vitest for tests.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build       # Build (required after changes)
pnpm test        # Run tests
pnpm dev         # Watch mode
```

Three sample apps in `test/fixtures/` cover different UI patterns for end-to-end testing: a SaaS dashboard (`sample-app`), a kanban board (`todo-app`), and a chat interface (`chat-app`).
